wp-plugin-in-gitbub
===================

Collection of shell scripts that I am using to manage and deploy WordPress Plugins from github into svn

- clone-from-svn-to-git.sh - Use this script to clone your WordPress Plugins from SVN into git/github
- deploy-plugin.sh - Use this script to push your WordPress Plugin updates to SVN from gi/github

TODO
-------------

Here is the list of things that I want to implement. Pull requests are welcome :)

- Better documentation
- In the deploy script, add support for assests/ folder
- In the deploy script, checkout only the trunk/ for the Plugin from svn
- Find ways to speed up things in the clone script
- Add batch support in the clone script
